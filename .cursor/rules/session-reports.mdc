# SESSION REPORT RULES

## Purpose

Document work completed during coding sessions for future reference and knowledge base.

---

## When to Create

Create session report when:
- User explicitly requests: "підведи підсумки", "create session summary", "summarize session"
- Major feature completion
- End of significant refactoring
- After fixing complex bugs
- At user's discretion

---

## Report Location

**Directory:** `.sessions/`

**File naming:** `YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`

**Examples:**
- `.sessions/2025-11-05-template-system.md` ✅
- `.sessions/2025-11-10-graph-visualization.md` ✅
- `.sessions/2025-11-15-auth-bug-fixes.md` ✅

**Why not gitignore:**
- Reports are indexed by codebase search
- AI can reference past sessions
- Team can learn from history
- Searchable knowledge base

---

## Tone and Objectivity

### ❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN

**DO NOT:**
- Declare "Production Ready" or "Ready for Production"
- Rate quality with stars (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
- Make judgments about project completeness
- Use words: "perfect", "excellent", "amazing", "flawless"
- Conclude user's business decisions
- Promise stability or reliability
- Claim "zero bugs" or "bug-free"

**Examples of FORBIDDEN statements:**
- ❌ "System is production-ready!"
- ❌ "Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Production Ready"
- ❌ "Perfect implementation, ready to deploy!"
- ❌ "Zero known issues"

### ✅ REQUIRED APPROACH

**DO:**
- State facts objectively
- Describe what WAS done, not how "good" it is
- List what WORKS and what DOESN'T
- Be honest about limitations and risks
- Mention remaining work explicitly
- Note what was NOT tested
- Acknowledge technical debt

**Examples of CORRECT statements:**
- ✅ "System implements core features X, Y, Z"
- ✅ "Testing coverage: manual only. Unit tests pending"
- ✅ "Works in development environment. Production testing not done"
- ✅ "Known limitations: A, B, C"

---

## Report Structure Template

```markdown
# Session Report: {Feature Name}

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}  
**Duration:** {Approximate time or "Full session" or "Multiple hours"}  
**Version:** {Before} → {After} (if applicable)

---

## Objective

{User's goal in their own words or paraphrased. What did they ask for?}

---

## Completed Tasks

### Backend
- ✅ Specific task 1
- ✅ Specific task 2
- ⚠️ Partially: task 3 (describe what's missing)

### Frontend  
- ✅ Task 1
- ✅ Task 2

### Documentation
- ✅ Updated/created specific files

### Other
- ✅ Any other work

---

## Changes

### Code Statistics
- New files: X
- Modified files: Y  
- Deleted files: Z
- Lines added: ~N (approximate)
- Lines removed: ~M

### File Structure Changes
```
path/to/
├── new_file.py        ✨ NEW
├── updated_file.py    ⚡ UPDATED
└── old_file.py        🗑️ DELETED
```

---

## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: {Descriptive Title}
**Problem:** {What wasn't working}  
**Cause:** {Why it happened}  
**Solution:** {How it was fixed}  
**Files affected:** {List files}  
**Risk:** {Could this happen again? What to watch for}

### Issue 2: ...

---

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. {What was learned about the technology/framework}
2. {New patterns discovered}

### Patterns Applied
- {Pattern name}: {Brief description}
- {Pattern name}: {Brief description}

### Mistakes Made
- ❌ {What approach didn't work}
- ✅ {What worked instead}
- 💡 {Why this matters for future}

---

## Testing

### What Was Tested
- ✅ {Feature 1}: manual testing
- ✅ {Feature 2}: manual testing

### What Was NOT Tested
- ⚠️ Unit tests
- ⚠️ Integration tests
- ⚠️ Performance under load
- ⚠️ Edge cases
- ⚠️ Production environment
- ⚠️ {Other}

### Known Limitations
- {Limitation 1}
- {Limitation 2}

---

## Remaining Work

### Must Do (Blocking)
- [ ] {Critical task}
- [ ] {Required for basic functionality}

### Should Do (Important)
- [ ] {Important but not blocking}
- [ ] {Quality improvement}

### Nice to Have (Future)
- [ ] {Enhancement idea}
- [ ] {Optimization}

---

## Git Activity

**Total commits:** X

### Breakdown by Type
- feat: X commits (new features)
- fix: X commits (bug fixes)
- docs: X commits (documentation)
- style: X commits (formatting, CSS)
- refactor: X commits (code improvements)
- chore: X commits (maintenance)

**Commits pushed to remote:** ✅ Yes / ⚠️ No (local only)

**Branch:** {branch name}

---

## Technical Debt

{Any shortcuts taken, temporary solutions, hacks, or things that should be refactored later}

Examples:
- Using `any` type in TypeScript (where: file.ts:123)
- TODO comments added (count: 5)
- Skipped validation for quick testing
- Hard-coded values that should be configurable

---

## Dependencies Changed

### Added
- {package@version} - {reason}

### Updated
- {package: old → new} - {reason}

### Removed
- {package} - {reason}

---

## Notes for Next Session

{Anything important to remember for next time}

Examples:
- Remember to rebuild containers
- Database schema changed - may need migration
- New environment variable required in .env
- Breaking changes in API

---

**Session Status:** {In Progress / Completed / Paused}  
**Next Focus:** {What should be tackled next}
```

---

## Content Requirements

### Objective Section
- Quote or paraphrase user's original request
- Keep it short (1-3 sentences)

### Changes Section
- Real numbers when possible
- Use ~approximations for large counts
- Show file tree with emoji markers (✨⚡🗑️)

### Issues Section  
**CRITICAL:** Document EVERY bug/problem encountered:
- Be specific about root cause
- Explain what was tried
- Note if it's a symptom of larger issue

### Lessons Learned
Focus on:
- Technical insights gained
- Patterns that emerged
- Anti-patterns avoided
- Knowledge for future sessions

### Remaining Work
**MANDATORY SECTION** - Never skip this!
- What's not done
- What needs testing
- What could be improved
- Technical debt created

### Testing Section

- List what was manually tested
- List what was NOT tested
- Note missing test types
- Acknowledge risks

## Example Opening (GOOD)

```markdown
# Session Report: Template System Implementation

**Date:** 2025-11-05
**Duration:** Full session
**Version:** 2.2.0 → 2.3.0

## Objective

User requested modernization of node creation in FalkorDB. Replace manual 
property input with template-based system where users select predefined 
templates with typed fields.

## Completed Tasks

### Backend
- ✅ Created template schemas (15+ Pydantic models)
- ✅ Implemented TemplateService (6 CRUD methods + migration)
...
```

---

## Example Opening (BAD - DON'T DO THIS)

```markdown
# Amazing Template System - Production Ready! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

We created the PERFECT template system that's 100% ready for production 
and has zero bugs! Everything works flawlessly!

**Quality:** Excellent  
**Readiness:** Production Ready  
**Status:** Perfect
```

**WHY BAD:**
- Makes claims beyond scope
- Not objective
- No useful information
- Ignores limitations

---

## Remember

**Your job:** Document what happened  
**NOT your job:** Judge if it's "ready"

Be the objective historian, not the cheerleader.
